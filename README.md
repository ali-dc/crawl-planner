# Bristol Pub Crawl Planner

<https://bristolpubcrawl.xyz>

Does what it says on the tin - plans Bristol-based pub crawl routes.

Only covers pubs based in the City Of Bristol (which includes Avonmouth for
some reason)

Credit to <https://bristol.pub/> for inspiration and also where I got the data from.
